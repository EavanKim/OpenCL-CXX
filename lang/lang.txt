== OpenCL {cpp} Programming Language

This section describes the OpenCL {cpp} programming language used to create kernels that are executed on OpenCL device(s).
The OpenCL {cpp} programming language is based on the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG21 N 3690 language specification (a.k.a. {cpp14} specification) with specific restrictions (__<<opencl_cxx_restrictions, OpenCL {cpp} restrictions>> section__).
Please refer to this specification for a detailed description of the language grammar.
This section describes restrictions to the {cpp14} specification supported in OpenCL {cpp}.
