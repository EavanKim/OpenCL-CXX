=== INF, NaN and Denormalized Numbers

INF and NaNs must be supported.
Support for signaling NaNs is not required.

Support for denormalized numbers with single precision floating-point is optional.
Denormalized single precision floating-point numbers passed as input or produced as the output of single precision floating-point operations such as add, sub, mul, divide, and the functions defined in <<math-functions,Math Functions>>, <<common-functions,Common Functions>> and <<geometric-functions,Geometric Functions>> may be flushed to zero.
